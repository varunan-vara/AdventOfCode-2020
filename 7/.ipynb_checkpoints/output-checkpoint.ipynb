    "Due to recent aviation regulations, many rules (your puzzle input) are being enforced about bags and their contents; bags must be color-coded and must contain specific quantities of other color-coded bags. Apparently, nobody responsible for these regulations considered how long they would take to enforce!\n",

    "For example, consider the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.\n",
    "dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.\n",
    "bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.\n",

    "faded blue bags contain no other bags.\n",
    "dotted black bags contain no other bags.\n",

    "You have a shiny gold bag. If you wanted to carry it in at least one other bag, how many different bag colors would be valid for the outermost bag? (In other words: how many colors can, eventually, contain at least one shiny gold bag?)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above rules, the following options would be available to you:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A bright white bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly.\n",
    "    A muted yellow bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly, plus some other bags.\n",
    "    A dark orange bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny gold bag.\n",
    "    A light red bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny gold bag.\n",
